Causation vs Correlation (Association)

COVID Vaccine

Causal: Taking the vaccine gives protection against Covid

Correlation (Association): The vaccine doesn't help at all. It's just that the people who took it were healthier or more caucious.




EXAMPLES:

Rainy days & lots of people coming to school with umbrellas

Not that umbrellas cause rainy days but that rainy days cause people to bring umbrellas. (there is always some sort of tempral relationship)



Sleeping with shoes on & waking up with a headache.
(explanatory)				(response)

The Confounder (a 3rd variable that is associative with both the explanatory and response variables) in this case it is if the person went to bed drunk or not.


=======================================================================

2 Types of studies

	Experiments (randomized trial) : Studies where the researcher 			controls who gets the explanatory var

	ex. T Trials (can establish causality)


	vs 



	Observational Studies (Cohort) : Studies in which the researcher observes but they never intervine.

	ex. Pediatric HIV/Aids cohort study (can not establish causality)

=======================================================================

=======================================================================

Clinical Trials:

			Control Group:
				- Placebo
				- Standard-of-care Group


			Blinding:
				-Single (study particiment not aware of which group they are in)

				-Double: (researchers dont know what group the participants are in either when evaluating them)

=======================================================================


Observational Studies:


Why not always use clinical trial:
	- Ethics
	- Expensive 
	- Time consuming
	- Inability to randomize treatment
	- Focused on one Question
	- Lots of data exists
