Categorical Variables.

Ex: Which dining hall do cold students prefer 3 levels (Dana, Bobs, Foss)



Frequency (one-way table) DANA| Bobs | Foss
			  6     12     6     (number of counts of each choice)
			(25%) (50%)  (25%)   (can also giver percentages of)




TYPES OF PLOTS FOR SINGLE CATEGORICAL VARIABLE:
		1. Bar Plot(Bar Chart) (MUCH preferred over pie charts)
			
		2. Pie Chart (REALLY BAD TRY NOT TO USE)




EX (2 categorical variables) Do diets differ b/t Colby and Bates students.
	The explanatory variable is what school you go to. 
	The response variable is a diet


	USE a 2 way table
	
			Diet
		meat   Veg   V
College	Colby.   142.   77.  31
	Bates.   50.    20.   5

Bates n = 75
Colby n = 250

There are different ways to propoqtinalize here since the sample sizes of each group are different.
Can divide by total sample.

	Row proportions (amoung each college the proportions)
	Col proportions (proportions amount different diet type. Sample sizes)
	Total Proportions (total sample size)

Proportions can be better for plotting bar charts with different proportion sizes.



What % of Colby student prefer Foss?

P = population

^
P (p hat) = sample statistic in this case = # who prefer foss \ n =100 (which is the sample size)
